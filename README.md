This project is some unofficial example of [libtraceevent](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/lib/traceevent). The `src/` folder contains a file to test the library.

Use `make` command tu build the code.

To run the program, execute `./traceevent_playground "file_path.dat"`

Note that this is a test program. It does not handle error, and has been tested on a little endian machine.
